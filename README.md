## Description

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

The motivation behind this assignment was to use what we have learned so far to finish and addon to a password generator.  The problem this project solves is having to use the samepassword repeatedly as well as being able to customize the password with the character type you choose.  The challenges presented in this project was how to confirm the choices of the user, how to select from the characters that were chosen by the user, and how to use the math functions to generate the password.
